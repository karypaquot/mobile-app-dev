    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Karina.
\n\nI love coding.
\n\nCoding is a form of art because one can create whatever they can imagine through programming
\nFun fact is that my first programming language was Java.
\n\n I love the problem solving through trial and error that comes with coding.
\nSometimes I spend hours coding
\nDuring those hours I can get a lot done or I can be stuck trying to solve one bug
\n\nI am so grateful to have discovered my love for programming
\n\nI\'m happy that I have landed a software engineering role to further expand my skills
\nI hope that in my role as a software engineer I can create something meaningful\n\n</string>
